- Need to remove an enemy if stuck in a tile, Could just push them out in the direction closest
that does not work find a solution, 

issues is colliding enemies can push other enemies into walls and using a lerp function to try and remove them in the opposite direction
works for small distances but if an enemy is pushed to far they can just clip themselves outside whatever inteded area they are in
